Maven and Gradle are build tools for Java based projects
Maven widely usedly in industry

Steps:

> Provision and EC2 instance which will server as the build server
> Install java 
( depending on the IMi used get installing instructions from documention/google)
> For Amazon Linux:
$ sudo yum install java-devel
$ java -version 

> Download Maven

$ sudo su
$ cd /opt
$ ls
$ wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.8.6/binaries/apache-maven-3.8.6-bin.tar.gz

(download of your version of Maven software)
$ ls
apache-maven-3.8.6-bin.tar.gz  aws  rh
$ tar -xvf apache-maven-3.8.6-bin.tar.gz
(unzip tar file) 
$ rm apache-maven-3.8.6-bin.tar.gz
(delete zipfile)
$cd apache-maven-3.8.6/
$ ls
$ cd bin
$ls
$ cd ..
$ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/apache-maven-3.8.6/bin
(adding bin directory to path variable$mvn to maven)
$ mvn -v

> Clone a source code from github
$ cd  (go to root dir and out of opt dir )
> Install git first
$ yum install git
$ git --version
$ git clone https://github.com/Noettie/Project1.git
$ ls 
$ cd Project1
pom.xml src 
$ vim pom.xml

pom.xml has the build commands and the src has the app source code developed by developers
> The pom.xml has the target directory where the artefact will be when the build is complete
deveps and the packaging is .war
$ ls -a
> Build the artefact using maven
$ mvn package
$ ls (a new dir called target should be there if buuild is success
$ cd ..
$ ls
> Running the build a second time takes a much shorter period since all the depency files are available locally
> First build slightly longer to download dependencies remotely
> The dependencies are available in a dir .m2
$ cd /opt
$ ls
$ cd apache-maven.....
> NB: Command to find a directory: 
$ find / -name .m2
$ cd 
$ ls -la
> Should find a dir .m2
$ cd Project1
> Change the pom.xml from war to jar
> clean and build 
$ mvn clean package
$ cd target
> The .war earlier build is removed and the .jar build is created
> INSTALL : install the package into the local repo, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
> IF requirement is to deploy artefact into local server for use in other projects
> Making the .jar file available in the local repo in :
$ /root/.m2/repository/org/example/devops/1.0-SNAPSHOT/devops-1.0-SNAPSHOT.pom
> The artefact wil now be available in local repository
> If you want to deploy into remote repo to share with other developers use the deploy command
> DEPLOY : done in build environment, copies the final package to the remote repo for sharing with other developers and ptojects
$ mvn deploy

> The artefact should be preserved
> For sourec code preserving this is done in Github and it is accessible by others
> Aretefacts are preserved in NEXUS or Jfrog
> THese are repository management tools
> These tools are used instead of github as the build file can be large after depencies ar downloaded
> There is a restriction of package storage in github which works for source code

# Nexus 

Provides storage to preserve multiple versions of artefacts

* Builds take alot of time
* Several artefacts are generated and hence versions are stored in nexus so they can rebuilt and takes less time

Steps to install Nexus

> Lanuch EC2 instance of t2.medium type
> To provison maven and nexus you require powerful servers and t2.micro will not suffice
> Network setting :open port 8081 for nexus
>Install java

$ sudo yum install java-1.8.0-open-jdk-devel
$ java -version
$ sudo su
$ cd /opt
$ wget https://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/nexus-3.42.0-01-unix.tar.gz
$ ls
$ tar -xvf nexus-3.42.0-01-unix.tar.gz
$ ls
$ rm <zipfile>
$ rm *.gz
$ cd nexus

> To start Nexus cd into bin dir
$ cd bin
$ contrib  nexus  nexus.rc  nexus.vmoptions
> Nexus should be started as a regular user not root user
> If you start applicastions as a root user , when you intergrate with other tools, access to some packages is denied
$ cd ..
$ bin  deploy  etc  lib  NOTICE.txt  OSS-LICENSE.txt  PRO-LICENSE.txt  public  replicator  system
